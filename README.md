# office-ui-fabric-react-hello

My personal tests on this React-wrapped library around Office UI Fabric components.

Started on boilerplate from https://github.com/Lemoncode/react-typescript-samples

##To get started:  
1. Install [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org)  
2. `npm install webpack -g` - Installs webpack
3. `npm install tsd -g` - Installs tsd
6. `npm install` - Installs packages
7. `npm start` - Builds the project and launch a lite web server (webpack-devserver).
8. Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) if your browser doesn't open automatically.

If 8080 is already in use on your machine (it is on mine), use this trigger:
`node_modules\.bin\webpack-dev-server --port 888`
